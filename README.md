# Plants vs. Zombies — x86 Assembly Project

This is a simplified clone of *Plants vs. Zombies*, programmed by me in x86 Assembly as part of a school project.


🧠 Built entirely from scratch, using Turbo Assembler and run through DOSBox.


🎮 To play:
1. Run the `.exe` file inside DOSBox.
2. Make sure all `.bmp` image files are in the **same folder** as the executable.


🌻💥🧟 Defend your garden, plant some peas, and stop the zombie invasion!
